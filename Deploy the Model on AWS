You can deploy the trained model using AWS EC2 or AWS Lambda for serverless deployment. Use AWS S3 to store your model and API Gateway to expose the Flask API.

Additional Enhancements:
Predictive Maintenance: Use IoT data to predict equipment failure using time-series data and machine learning models.
Customizable Quality Standards: Build configuration settings where manufacturers can input industry-specific quality parameters for defect detection.
This code is a starting point. You can further optimize it for performance and scalability based on your specific requirements.
